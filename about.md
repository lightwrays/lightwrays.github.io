## Who is Chris Wray

I'm a Software Engineer, Leader, and Manager with over 20 years of software development experience building solutions for multiple high profile companies.

After graduating from the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/), I've had great opportunities building software solutions for various industries and domains. I've worked in a few design agencies building custom software and high scale E-Commerce Websites for high profile clients. I've built and implemented Warehouse Management software leveraging wireless devices and barcode solutions to automate inventory management. I've architected and developed custom Enterprise Software for a Law Firm which spanned multiple offices across States from Alaska to Hawaii, and scaled out the solution to thousands of concurrent users. I was the architect working on a large Online Multiplayer Game, and part of the vision for the next version of the distributed and scalable platform. And I've been in the streaming media industry creating high profile streaming media apps for Xbox and PlayStation devices.  I've had the opportunity to create some exciting solutions (and learn a number of things along the way).

While I'm not at my workstation creating things, you'll likely find me hanging out with my family, snowboarding, listening to great music, cooking and eating tasty things, all while documenting everything with my trusty iPhone camera.
