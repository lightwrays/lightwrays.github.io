# Chris Wray's Site/Blog

The code and content for my site/blog, located at [http://www.lightwrays.com](http://www.lightwrays.com).

Setup as a repository and site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).  Since GitHub Pages uses the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog engine, running locally requires `jekyll` and can be installed and run from the local folder with the following commands.

    $ gem install jekyll
    $ cd [site folder]
	# where [site folder] is the local folder location of the site
    $ jekyll serve
    # view the site locally being served at http://localhost:4000
